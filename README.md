# 👋 Hi there, thank you for visiting my GitHub profile!

😊 I'm ywbyeol, a junior developer studying in South Korea.

🎮 I get a lot of joy out of building my new technical skill stack, much like I do when I'm growing a character in an RPG game.

📚 Currently, I've been fascinated by the [Rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and am studying it to use it as my primary language instead of Javascript.

💕 All stars and comments for my repository and all kinds of contact with me are welcome!

📝 I study algorithms mainly through [Baekjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/) problems and aim to solve at least 1 problem per day.
